OCTOBER 2009
RAIN GAUGE LOGGER REPLACEMENTS

- NOTE: At the end of the 2009 field season, data from all rain gauges was compiled to 
determine which rain gauge loggers were still collecting data and which were inconsistant
and failing. The following list of replacements is compiled from inconsistant data 
recovered from the logger units. The old loggers were replaced with the new UA-003-64
model in October 2009. 
- Old loggers are stored  in the 'Old Hobo Logger' box in the lab.
- See rain gauge summary documents for further details regarding data collected from the spring
through october, as well as new rain gauge serial numbers and locations.
