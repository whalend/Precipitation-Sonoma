2009 RAIN GAUGE PREPERATION:
---------------------------------------------------

1. Replace all batteries in rain gauges
> Battery type: Ray-O-Vac CR2032, QTY.15

2. Depending on if RG collected data 08-09 will depend on if we replace them. The type of rain gauge logger that currently
exists in the shield are retired. Please contact Onset Computer Corp. to determine alternatives and cost.
> Current RG: Model: H07-002-004
> Questions for Onset: 
-If you replace the logger battery, what is the probability it will continue logging for another year?
-Can you relaunch non-logging logger with portable shuttle device or would it be more effect to use a laptop? If so, how?
-Will new RG logger units fit inside existing shields?
-How much would it cost to just have the old RG logger unit send in for repairs? What is the probability it would continue logging for another year?

3. Rain gauges that will most likely need to be replaced are:
> Kunde: has not logged or provided any data in the last three years (06)
> Mitsui: has provided incomplete data for the last three years. Ended log early in '08
> Spaulinding: has consistantly provided imcomplete data. 
> Beltane: Ended log early in '08

4. Determine if replacing RG's is in our budget?

5. Return to plots and replace if needed?
