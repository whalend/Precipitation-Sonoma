I've come across some rain gauge files in the root directory: 
     "Sonoma\...\Plot_Network\Data\Field\Microclimate|PROCESSING_micrcoclimate\Working Files\2004.09.15 Working\Exported\RainGauge1".

I'm pretty sure these are the rain gauges that Brian Anacker ran through his "RainGaugeMarco.xls" program.  

These "Processed" data might be good to feed into spatial interpolation anlayses.
