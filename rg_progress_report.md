## Precipitation Interpolation for Sonoma County

Project location: P:\geospatial\Research\rkmeente\Workspaces\wwdillon\soco_ppt

#### Goal: summarize the precipitation events into hourly and daily values
`Conversion factor: 1 event = 0.01 inches`

These data (likely in combination with other available external data) are primarily intended for calculating surfaces of precipitation variables that are of interest for modeling *P. ramorum* and SOD in the Sonoma County study system. Other uses may include use for examining various methodological applications related to modeling precipitation at relatively fine spatial scales.

10/8/2014 -  The files in the *all_years_raw_exports* folder have been revised to include and `id` column with the location (landowner) name. These now all share the same column names and what I hope is the same format of the data in each column.

I have been backing up a copy of the *soco_ppt* folder onto my flash drive.
